# Malware Detection Using Deep Learning

In this project, I have presented techniques for detecting Malware Files using Neural Networks. Here, we use malware and benign apks of Android applications for creating our dataset. The apk is converted into an image file, which is then passed through the Neural Network model for categorisation as 'Benign' or 'Malware' file. 

### File Descriptions

#### Module 1

I have included scripts which convert the apk files into their respective images. I have also included the implementation of a ConvNet model that performs image categorization between 'Benign' and 'Malware' images.

Scripts:

1. script_apk_1.py: This script converts the apk into it's image representation

2. runner_benign.py / runner_malware.py: Scripts that iterate over the apk dataset to get the images dataset

3. Architecture.ipynb: Implementation of the ConvNet Architecture, which consists of 3 Conv layers and one Fully-Connected layer

4. Evaluation.ipynb: Classifies the images into 'Benign'/'Malware' categories

#### Module 2

Here, I have tried to analyze the impact of the number of convolutional layers on the accuracy of the model. 

Scripts:

1. model_1_64_64.ipynb: ConvNet with 1 conv layer

2. model_2_64_64.ipynb: ConvNet with 2 conv layer

3. model_3_64_64.ipynb: ConvNet with 3 conv layer

4. PCA.ipynb: I tried to determine the difference in the distance of benign files from malware files and distance of malware files from each other

#### Module 3

I implemented various kinds of feature selection models to extract features from the images of the files. 

Using sklearn, I implemented the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), SelectKBest, Select Percentile and Tree Based Feature Selection. 

I also implemented an Autoencoder to extract features from the images and then used the distances between the two classes of images to categorize the images.
